And here's some Emacs Lisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(def-package! org-gcal
  :commands (org-gcal-sync
             org-gcal-fetch
             org-gcal-post-at-point
             org-gcal-delete-at-point)
  :config
  (load-file "~/.emacs-secrets.el")
  ;; hack to avoid the deferred.el error
  (defun org-gcal--notify (title mes)
    (message "org-gcal::%s - %s" title mes)))
#+END_SRC
